Side project for use by myself, friends and people who we meet to organize adventures.

Uses React and firebase. Firebase keys are not commited. To run this application, create a firebase_config.json file at the root of the application that contains firebase configuration:

```json
{
    "apiKey": "API-KEY",
    "authDomain": "AUTH-DOMAIN",
    "databaseURL": "DATABASE-URL",
    "storageBucket": "STORAGE-BUCKET",
    "messagingSenderId": "SENDER-ID"
};
```
